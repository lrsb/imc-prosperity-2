From round0_iter1 (A: 1847, S:1622.917969) : Baseline
iter 1 (A:1764, S:1742.639648): 
- Surge pricing optimized over backtester
iter 2 (A:1847, S:1743):
- Combining baseline and iter 1 configuration
iter 3_ref (A:1702, S:1599.917969) vs iter 3 (A:1480 S:1393.917969):
- Adding queue maximization 
iter 4 (A:1591, S: 1595.917969):
- Queue maximization certainly does not add anything


Ideas:
- Inventory in starfruits tend to be more limit constrained than in Ameth (Confirmed)
- The current scheduling function thresholds might be too wide for Ameth (Rejected)
- Backtester shows large deviation(well ~5%). It seems that the backtester is a tad bit too optimistic
- Limit order placement based on trade volume and frequency
- 

ToDo:
- Need to check the consistency of the reference price
