From round0_iter1 (A: 1847, S:1622.917969) : Baseline
iter 1 (A:1764, S:1742.639648): 
- Surge pricing optimized over backtester
iter 2 (A:1847, S:1743):
- Combining baseline and iter 1 configuration

Ideas:
- Inventory in starfruits tend to be more limit constrained than in Ameth (Confirmed)
- The current scheduling function thresholds might be too wide for Ameth (Rejected)
- Backtester shows large deviation for amethysts. It seems that the backtester is a bit too optimistic
- Limit order placement based on trade volume and frequency

ToDo:
- Need to check the consistency of the reference price
