iter 1 (A:3667, S:3451.976563): 
- reference price calculated from the average of outermost orders
- Stale orders taking
- "Surge pricing" inventory scheduling
iter 2 (A:3667, 3442.976563)
- Removing surge pricing inventory scheduling

Running hypothesis:
- Inventory in starfruits tend to be more limit constrained than in Ameth
- The current scheduling function thresholds might be too wide for Ameth

ToDo:
- Make a working backtester ASAP
- Need to check the consistency of the reference price
